# Trading Dashboard - Enhanced Claude Code Configuration

## System Architecture Rules

### Core Trading Intelligence Principles
- **VIGL Pattern Authority**: Your proven 324% algorithm is the primary discovery engine
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: All decisions consider market timing, portfolio state, and pattern confidence
- **Learning Integration**: Every action contributes to the 30-day validation experiment
- **Risk-First Approach**: WOLF scoring prevents >80% of significant losses

### Development Environment Standards
- **Preserve Working Architecture**: Never modify core VIGL discovery logic
- **Enhance Intelligence**: Focus on context synthesis and pattern recognition
- **Maintain Performance**: Keep API response times <2 seconds
- **Data Integrity**: Protect trading data and maintain discovery accuracy

### Claude Code Integration Patterns
- **Discovery Enhancement**: Use hooks for pattern validation and enrichment
- **Context Optimization**: Leverage 200k+ token windows for market analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream discovery data through MCP servers
- **Learning Synthesis**: Aggregate pattern performance for model improvement

### API Integration Requirements
- **Alpaca Trading**: Paper trading account for position management
- **Polygon Market Data**: Real-time price feeds and volume analysis  
- **VIGL Discovery**: Python engine integration with SQLite storage
- **Portfolio Intelligence**: Real-time risk analysis and alert generation

### Performance Optimization Standards
- **Database Efficiency**: SQLite operations optimized for market data velocity
- **API Rate Limits**: Intelligent caching and request batching
- **Memory Management**: Context optimization for large market datasets
- **Real-time Updates**: 30-minute refresh cycles with critical alerts immediate

### Learning Experiment Integration
- **Data Collection**: Automatic logging of discoveries, decisions, and outcomes
- **Pattern Validation**: Track VIGL similarity vs actual performance
- **Model Enhancement**: Use feedback to improve confidence scoring
- **Success Metrics**: >70% pattern success rate, >80% risk prevention

### Trading Workflow Rules
- **Pattern Discovery**: VIGL engine scans 6000+ stocks â†’ identifies 10-20 patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: WOLF scoring for each position and discovery
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Real-time P&L tracking with intelligent alerts
- **Decision Support**: Actionable recommendations based on pattern confidence

### Security and Compliance
- **API Key Management**: Environment variables with secure token rotation
- **Data Protection**: Trading data encryption and backup procedures
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all trading decisions and outcomes
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API usage within provider constraints

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation if individual APIs fail
- **Data Validation**: Multiple validation layers for market data integrity
- **Backup Systems**: Alternative data sources and discovery engines
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automatic restart and data synchronization

### Project-Specific Patterns
- **VIGL Similarity Scoring**: Confidence based on volume, momentum, price patterns
- **Portfolio Risk Weighting**: Position size and decline percentage factors
- **Alert Priority System**: Critical (>15% moves), Medium (portfolio changes), Low (market timing)
- **Discovery Action Mapping**: Score >5.0 = BUY, 3.0-5.0 = MONITOR, 2.0-3.0 = WATCHLIST

This system represents the leading edge of AI-assisted trading, where context engineering enables sophisticated pattern recognition and risk management that exceeds manual analysis capabilities.
