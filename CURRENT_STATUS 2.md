# Trading Dashboard - Current Status Summary

## üöÄ What's Working

### 1. AlphaStack Discoveries System ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced discovery engine** with 8-component upgrade system fully implemented
- **Two-tier momentum gates**: Trade-ready (‚â•2.0x volume, >3.5% move, above VWAP) and Early-ready (‚â•1.5x volume with catalyst)
- **Cold-tape relaxation**: Activates after 10min with no Trade-ready candidates, caps scores at 74
- **Seeding mechanism**: Ensures UI never goes blank, generates catalyst and fallback candidates
- **UI with tier badges**: Green (TRADE_READY), Amber (EARLY_READY), Blue (WATCH)
- **Buy buttons**: $100 for Trade-ready, $50 for Early-ready with real bracket order placement
- **30-minute auto-scan intervals**: Configured via environment variables (ALERTS_MINUTES=30, SCAN_INTERVAL_MIN=30)

### 2. Live Portfolio Intelligence (Partially Working) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Portfolio display**: Shows current positions from Alpaca API
- **Basic alerts**: Generates portfolio alerts saved to JSON files
- **UI integration**: Portfolio positions visible in dashboard
- **Issue**: Not providing actionable management recommendations for each held stock

## üîß What Needs to Be Finished

### 1. Live Portfolio Intelligence - Stock Management
**Current Gap**: System shows positions but doesn't tell user what to do with each stock

**Needed Features**:
- **Per-stock recommendations**: BUY_MORE, HOLD, TRIM, SELL with clear reasoning
- **Exit strategy**: Stop-loss levels, take-profit targets, time-based exits
- **Position sizing**: How much more to buy or how much to trim
- **Risk assessment**: VIGL pattern analysis, WOLF risk detection
- **Thesis tracking**: Original buy thesis vs current market conditions

### 2. Learning System Integration
**Status**: Built but not integrated

**Needed Integration**:
- Connect learning system to track trade outcomes
- Feed successful/failed patterns back into discovery engine
- Adjust scoring weights based on historical performance
- Create feedback loop for continuous improvement

### 3. SMS Alert System
**Status**: Not implemented

**Needed**:
- Twilio integration for SMS notifications
- Alert when Trade-ready candidates discovered
- Portfolio position alerts (stop-loss hit, take-profit reached)
- Critical risk warnings

## üìÅ Key File Locations

### Discovery System
- `/config/discovery.js` - Central configuration
- `/server/services/squeeze/gates_optimized.js` - Two-tier momentum gates
- `/server/services/discovery_service.js` - Core discovery with cold-tape seeding
- `/public/components/thesis-discovery.js` - Frontend UI with buy buttons

### Portfolio Intelligence
- `/server/services/portfolio-intelligence.js` - Portfolio analysis service
- `/utils/portfolio_intelligence.js` - Portfolio intelligence utility
- `/public/js/enhancedPortfolio.js` - Enhanced portfolio UI

### Learning System
- Location TBD - Need to identify where learning system files are

### Configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables (API keys, intervals)
- `/alpha-preflight.sh` - System health check script

## üéØ Next Steps Priority

### Step 1: Complete Portfolio Intelligence (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Implement per-stock action recommendations
2. Add position sizing calculations
3. Create exit strategy for each position
4. Wire up to UI to show clear actions

### Step 2: Integrate Learning System
1. Locate learning system files
2. Connect to discovery and portfolio systems
3. Create feedback mechanisms
4. Test learning loop

### Step 3: Deploy to Render
1. Test all systems locally
2. Update environment variables on Render
3. Push to GitHub (main branch)
4. Monitor deployment logs
5. Run preflight checks on production

## üö® Current Issues to Fix

1. **Portfolio Intelligence Gap**: Not providing actionable per-stock guidance
2. **Learning System**: Built but not connected
3. **SMS Alerts**: No SMS notification system
4. **Production Deployment**: Need to push completed system to Render

## üíª Current Environment

- **Local Server**: Running on port 3003
- **Engine**: Optimized engine selected
- **Cold-tape**: Active with 5-second window (testing)
- **Database**: SQLite (trading_dashboard.db)
- **APIs**: Polygon (market data), Alpaca (trading)

## üìä Test Status

Last preflight check:
- ‚úÖ Server reachable
- ‚úÖ Scan triggered successfully
- ‚úÖ 10 WATCH candidates returned (cold-tape active)
- ‚úÖ Portfolio endpoint working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cold-tape active (expected during low momentum)

## üîë Key Decisions Made

1. Used thesis-first approach over "chip soup"
2. Implemented progressive gate filtering
3. Added fallback seeding for empty grids
4. Configured 30-minute scan intervals
5. Real bracket orders with 10% stop-loss, 15% take-profit

## üìù For ChatGPT Next Steps

The immediate priority is to:

1. **Complete the Live Portfolio Intelligence system** to provide clear, actionable recommendations for each stock in the portfolio (BUY_MORE, HOLD, TRIM, SELL with reasoning)

2. **Integrate the learning system** that's already built to create a feedback loop between trades and future discoveries

3. **Deploy the completed system to Render** for production use

The AlphaStack Discovery system is working well, finding opportunities with the two-tier momentum system. The missing piece is the Portfolio Intelligence not telling the user what to do with each held position.
